##Get the password by keystroking

As digitalization advances, we increasingly rely on digital devices to accomplish many tasks. Consequently, the importance of cybersecurity has grown. When we enter passwords using digital devices, the sound they produce is inevitable, and this sound poses a threat to security. In the past, identifying the words from the sounds of typing was a challenging task. However, in modern times, technologies for processing sound and recording keyboard sounds have significantly advanced. Moreover, within the realm of deep learning, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) technology has made it even more feasible to carry out acoustic attacks on keyboards. Acoustic Side-Channel attacks, abbreviated as Acoustic Side-Channel attacks, are a form of attack that leverages sound signals to compromise the security of computers and other electronic devices. Such attacks are executed by using audio sensors or microphones to expose or steal sensitive information, especially computer activities like keyboard input.


Using CNN, we will actually find out password. This study aims to explore the feasibility of acoustic attacks on keyboards by training deep learning models with keyboard sounds. Through this research, we aim to assess the vulnerabilities in keyboard security and detect new security threats. Ultimately, we aim to provide fresh insights into research that can prevent such attacks.
